I was born on August 10, 1991 in Vibo Valentia, Italy.
I received the BSc degree in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Florence in 2013.
I received the M.Sc. degree cum laude in Management Engineering from the University of Siena in 2015 with a thesis entitled _Minimum Switching Precision Pointing with On/Off Actuators_.
I received the Ph.D. Degree in Information Engineering and Science at the Department of Information Engineering and Mathematics, University of Siena, under the supervision of Prof. Andrea Garulli and Prof. Antonio Giannitrapani with a thesis entitled _Distributed Algorithms for Set Membership Estimation and Constrained Nonconvex Optimization_.

Since December 2018 I am a Research Fellow at the Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering “Guglielmo Marconi”, University of Bologna. My research interests include Distributed Optimization, Machine Learning and Algorithms.
